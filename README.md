## Hi 👋

I’m a software engineer and creative developer, building immersive, highly visual apps, games, and websites that rethink how people interact with digital tools. I specialise in blending design, interactivity, and technology to create experiences that feel more engaging and intuitive.

Founder of [4610](https://4610.software)🃏, where I explore new ways to make software more interactive. My latest project, BetterBacklog, is a reimagined task management tool that turns work into a tangible, 3D visual experience.

Just launched ClickUp Champ on Firefox & Chrome.

I'm also a Software Engineering Manager at Oxford Quantum Circuits.

If you like the things I do, you can support me through 4610 on Ko-Fi 👇
